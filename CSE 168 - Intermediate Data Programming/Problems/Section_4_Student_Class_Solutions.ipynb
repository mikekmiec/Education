        "You are considering adding a `class_standing` field which will store the class standing (freshman, sophomore, etc.) as a string. Answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* What are some **benefits** to storing a `class_standing` field?\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"color:red\">We wouldn't need to loop through the entire dictionary of classes whenever we want to get a student's class standing.</span>.\n",

        "* What are some **drawbacks** of storing a `class_standing` field?\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"color:red\">As the coders we would need to ensure that the class_standing is recalculated every time `classes` is modified (ie in the `add_class` method). This can be hard to keep track of.<br> Another issue is that since python doesn't *really* have private fields/methods, the client could directly modify the classes field and this would not update the `class_standing` field. <br> `class_standing` will require more memory which can be an issue.</span>.\n",

        "    Some ideas:\n",
        "    1. Call `calc_standing` when `classes` is initialized\n",
        "    2. Call `calc_standing` after `classes` is updated in the method `add_class`. \n",
        "    3. Make the `classes` field private (rename it `_classes`) \n",
        "    4. Make a new method to return a copy of `classes` so the client couldn't modify the classes field.\n",
        "    5. When `classes` is initialized consider making a copy of it so the client can't modify it.\n",
        "</span>.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Based on all of the modifications you made, do you think it's a good idea to store a `class_standing` ?\n",
        "\n",
        "<span style=\"color:red\">You need to weigh program speed against maintainability and program complexity. You need to think about if program speedup is really worth all the extra stuff you need to keep track of to ensure your program works correctly.</span>. "
