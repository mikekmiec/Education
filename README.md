# Education

I completed CSE 163 from UW and included all related documents (e.g. tests, homework, lectures, etc)

Below is a short summary of each homework assignement:

1. Python basics.
2. Processing CSV Data - Process structured data (Pokemon) in Python with CSV files as input with pandas and without.
3. Data Analysis - Use Pandas to process structured data in Python with CSV files. Use Seaborn to make plots. Train a machine learning model and use it to make a prediction about the future using the scikit-learn library.
4. Python Classes and Search Engines - Understand fundamental document and term ranking algorithms to implement a basic search engine. Specifically the TF-IDF algorithm which computes term-frequency and inverse document frequency.
6. Processing Geospatial Data - Investigate food deserts in Washington state, using geopandas to graph geospatial information on a map and combine multiple datasets.
7. Processing Image Data - Import image into a program from a file. Work with numpy arrays to perform computations
